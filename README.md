# ucsd-colleges-credit-calculator
A web-based application to help high school seniors 
determine how much AP Credit will be accepted at each 
UC San Diego undergraduate college.

This application uses the official undergraduate requirements found at
https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/pdf/APC-chart.pdf to determine how many credits
each AP Couse counts for at each UC San Diego college. College-specific
requirements can be found at each undergraduate college's general education
requirement page, which can be accessed at https://admissions.ucsd.edu/why/colleges/
